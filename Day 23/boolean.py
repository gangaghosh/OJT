# Boolean 
# Booleans are either true or false. There are two constants, True and False, that can be used to assign a value directly. Python expects an expression to evaluate to a boolean value. These places are called boolean contexts. We can write any expression in boolean contexts.

# Example 1

a=True
print(a)

# In Python, booleans can be treated as numbers. True value is 1 and a False value is 0. You can also do any operation between boolean values in Python. 

# Example 2
a=True
b=True
print(a+b)

# Example 3
a=False
b=True
print(a-b)

# Example 4
a=True
b=False
print(a*b)

# Example 5
a=True
b=False
print(a/b)
