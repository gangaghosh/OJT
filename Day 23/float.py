# Float 
# Float values are values that contain decimal points or a value that contains an exponent and mantissa
p=3.14
print("Type of P is\n")
print(type(p))
print('\n\nValue of P is : %f'%p)

# We can also represent a floating-point number in E notation.

# Example
a=1.50E+2
e=1.602E-19
sl=3.0E+8
print(a)
print(e)
print(sl)
