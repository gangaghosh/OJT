# Integer
# An Integer type holds an integer value or a whole number that can be a negative or positive value, like -5, -4, 0, 8, 9, 10, and so on.

a=12
print(a)


# type(variable) 
# But in the preceding example, you cannot determine the type of the Variable. So in Python we have a function by which we can get the type of a variable
# Example 
a=12
print(type(a))

# in Octal
a=0o14
print(a)

# In Hexa-Decimal
a=0XC
print(a)
